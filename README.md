# Github boards with Scrum

This repository is to demonstrate an example of how to use Github boards with Scrum


## Issue types

- **Epics** are milestones that contain all tasks and user stories related to that epic
- **User stories** are issues with:
  - the `user story` label
  - a check list referring to the tasks in the user story
  - a link to a milestone
- **Tasks** are issues with:
  - the `task` label
  - a link to a milestone
  
## Estimations

Estimations is done using size labels on user stories and task, for example `size/L`, `size/S`

## Prioritization

Prioritization is done using priority labels on user stories and tasks, for example `priority/Low`, `priority/High`

## Sprints

Sprints are managed using projects, with a single project representing a single sprint, for example: [Sprint 0 board](https://github.com/EliiseS/board-demo/projects/1). Once a sprint is finished, the project can be closed

## Backlog

Backlog is managed using a single board called `backlog`, found [here](https://github.com/EliiseS/board-demo/projects/2). The project contains a column for each sprint

## Parking lot

In addition, for managing the daily stand up parking lot there's a [`Parking lot` project](https://github.com/EliiseS/board-demo/projects/3) avaliable to add issues up for discussion
